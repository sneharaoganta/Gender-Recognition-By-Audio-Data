# Gender-Recognition-By-Audio-Data

Gender Classification using different algorithms for classification i.e 
K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XgBoost, Support Vector Machine and Neural Network i.e. MLP classifier to generate results. 

On comparing we got 98.74% accuracy which is the highest accuracy from XgBoost algorithm.

Further research: The above results have been generated using adult voice samples so future research could explore classification using children voice samples.

I have collected some voice samples from children and have attempted pre-processing the raw data to use for further research. Feel free to reach out to me, to talk more about it.
